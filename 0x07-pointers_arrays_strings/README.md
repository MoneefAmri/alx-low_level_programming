#C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

 - **0-memset.c:** This function fills a specified number of bytes in a memory area with a given constant byte. It returns a pointer to the memory area.
 
 - **1-memcpy.c:** The memcpy function copies a specified number of bytes from one memory area to another. It returns a pointer to the destination memory area.
 
 - **2-strchr.c:** This function searches for the first occurrence of a specific character in a string. If found, it returns a pointer to that character in the string. If not found, it returns NULL.
 
 - **3-strspn.c:** The strspn function calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists only of characters from a specified set. It returns the number of characters in the segment.
 
 - **4-strpbrk.c:** This function searches a string for the first occurrence of any character from a specified set of characters. If found, it returns a pointer to that character in the string. If not found, it returns NULL.

 - **5-strstr.c:** The strstr function finds the first occurrence of a specified substring within a string.

 - **7-print_chessboard.c:** This function is responsible for printing a chessboard. It takes a 2D array representing the chessboard as input and displays it on the screen. The chessboard is typically an 8x8 grid with alternating black and white squares.

 - **8-print_diagsums.c:** This function calculates the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. It takes a square matrix as input and computes the sum of the elements along the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) and the sum of the elements along the secondary diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left). The function then prints these two sums.
    

 - **100-set_string.c:** This function is used to set the value of a pointer to a char. It takes two arguments: a pointer to a pointer to a char (char**) and a string (char*). The function assigns the memory address of the string to the pointer, effectively updating the value it points to.

 - **101-crackme_password:** This is a file that contains the password for "crackme2".
